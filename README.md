Spotify premium trial is over? <br> Download your favourite playlist's songs to your computer.
I used the spotify API to take a playlist from my spotify account and download the songs in it to my computer as mp3/mp4 files.

How it looks like:

and when you press the ctrl button the playlist's uri will be shown, copy it and past it in app.py on line 29.
Now run the script and follow the link you see in the teminal. Hit the download button and the songs will be downloaded to your downloads dir in a folder called songs.

**NOTE**: you need spotify credentials so it would be able to access your account. Go in [here](https://developer.spotify.com/) and create your credentials.
